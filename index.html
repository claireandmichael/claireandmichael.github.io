								<h2>Flying to Victoria or Vancouver</h2>
								<p> We recommend flying to the airport closest to the venue, which is Victoria International Airport (YYJ). However, if you found an amazing deal direct to Vancouver International Airport (YVR), or if you just want to see Vancouver, that's totally an option as well. Just keep in mind that Vancouver is a two-hour ferry ride away from Victoria.</p>

								<h2>Getting Around</h2>
								<p>Public transit on the Island can be tedious, so we recommend renting a car once you land at the airport in order to make the most of the experience. If you’re traveling alone, or on a tight budget, just get in touch with us and we will make sure to sort out a way to get you a ride to and from the airport.</p>

								<h2>Lodging</h2>
								<p> AirBnB is the best option for lodging on the Island, especially if you're able to book as a group. When booking a rental, keep in mind that the wedding is in the town of Cobble Hill. AirBnb hosts can be found within 15 minutes of Cobble Hill in the surrounding towns of Shawnigan Lake, Mill Bay, or Cowichan Bay. Staying in the city of Victoria, 1 hour south of Cobble Hill, is also a great option for people wanting to explore the small coastal city. If you're feeling rustic, as is encouraged on the Island, we're offering free overnight camping at the wedding venue. All you'll need is your camping gear! If you're thinking of going this route, be sure to let us know so we know how many campers we can expect.

								<h2>Honeymoon: you're all invited</h2>
								<p>From August 13th-i17th, we'll be spending our honeymoon in the small surfing town of Tofino! Since many of you are coming from out of town, and may want to experience more of the west coast, everyone is welcome to join! Camping and AirBnB are both great options for lodging here as well. However, this small town gets booked up fast during the summer months. If you're planning on joining in on the fun, we recommend locking down your accommodation as soon as possible. </p>

        <p>Claire and Michael met at a friendly neighbourhood rock climbing gym in the Mile End neighbourhood of Montreal and their friendship quickly formed and flourished around their shared interest in the outdoors. Over the years, Claire and Michael each separately came to the conclusion that this was more than just friendship. Before long, they were romantically entwined and leaving Montreal together in search of broader horizons on the West Coast. They would spend the next two years sharing the confined space of an old plumbing van as their only home, trusting each other on harrowing rock climbs in Squamish, and getting in over their heads on their long surf safari from Vancouver Island to Mexico. These shared experiences gave birth to a connection far greater than what either of them could have ever imagined having with another person. Finally, on the first cold evening of Fall back in Montreal, they huddled together in their cozy Mile End apartment and expressed their wishes to spend their lives with one another. Now they’re counting the days until they can make a lifetime commitment to one another before their friends and family.
