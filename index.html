								<h2>Flying to Victoria or Vancouver</h2>
								<p>If you can believe it, Vancouver Island has their own airport, Victoria International Airport (YYJ), and we recommend flying there. That way you are already on the Island. If you found an amazing deal on a flight to Vancouver International Airport (YVR) or just want to see Vancouver, that’s totally an option. Just keep in mind that you will have to take a ferry over to the Island.</p>

								<h2>Getting Around</h2>
								<p>Public transit is doable on the Island, but a real rigamarole. So if it’s an option for you, it’s best to rent a vehicle, probably from the airport. If you’re traveling alone, or on a tight budget, just  get in touch with us and we will make sure to sort out a way to get you a ride to and from the airport, we promise!</p>

								<h2>Lodging</h2>
								<p>We love AirBnB! Especially if you are a family or traveling in a group, it’s extremely cost effective. When booking a rental, keep in mind that the wedding is in Cobble Hill, so if you would like to be nearby (15 minutes drive or less) keep your searches to Cobble Hill, Shawnigan Lake, Mill Bay, Cowichan Bay. If you would like to stay in the City of Victoria thats cool too, it’s about an hour’s drive from where the wedding will take place. If you’re feeling rustic, as Vancouver Island encourages, we suggest camping! We will provide free camping on Claire’s mom’s property. So just bring your camping gear! If you want to go this route just shoot us a message so we know how many squatters we can expect!</p>

								<h2>Honeymoon: you're all invited</h2>
								<p>The Monday after the wedding, we are going on our Honeymoon to Tofino! As so many of you are coming from out of town, it would be really fun to spend more time with you, so why don’t you come too! For those that haven’t been, Tofino is a small surfing town on the west coast of Vancouver Island, about 5 hours drive from Victoria. Many tourists visit during the summer months to take in the expansive sand beaches, take a surf lesson, walk through old growth forests,or go whale watching, to name a few activities! You’re going to need a car again, since getting there is a trek. AirBnB is a good option here too. You will want to search Tofino, Ucluelet is the other closest town, about 40 minutes away. There is also a hostel (hi hostel) and our personal favourite the Pacific Rim National Park Campsite, Green Point campsite. There are other campsites and hotels around, if these don’t sound ideal to you.

        <p>Claire and Michael met at a friendly neighbourhood rock climbing gym in the Mile End neighbourhood of Montreal. A friendship quickly formed and flourished around their shared interest in the outdoors. Over the years, Claire and Michael each separately came to the conclusion that this was more than just friendship. Before long, they were romantically entwined and leaving Montreal together in search of broader horizons on the West Coast. They would spend the next two years sharing the confined space of an old plumbing van as their only home, trusting each other on harrowing rock climbs in Squamish, and solving unforeseen problems on their long surf safari from Vancouver Island to Mexico. These shared experiences gave birth to a connection far greater than what either of them could have ever imagined having with another person. Finally, on the first cold evening of Fall back in Montreal, they huddled together in their cozy Mile End apartment and expressed their wishes to spend their lives with one another. Now they’re counting the days until they can make a lifetime commitment to one another before their friends and family
